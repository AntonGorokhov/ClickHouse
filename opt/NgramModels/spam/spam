Congratulations. You have touched the face of, and named, the next generation of boundless high-performance
capacity/capability computing.... enabling grand-challenge class problems to escape the homogeneous and
carefully-architected-for-consistent-predictability world of homogeneous, massive-scale but severely
scale-bounded systems. Enabling the platform Google can never afford to build - to index much more than a thin 
veneer of the whole Web, and to harness the billions of available systems into a coherent computing infrastructure.
Now there's just the matter of handling failures, wildly-varying latencies and node performance levels, building 
in redundancy, and cryptographically obfuscating both instructions and data and fully decentralizing control to 
prevent the inevitable interloper attacks.    Extracting predictable levels of reliable determinism from a chaotic 
soup of computational and network capabilities.
Congratulations, youâ€™ve won
